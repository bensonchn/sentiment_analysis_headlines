# sentiment_analysis_headlines

## What does it do?
This scrapes each headlines news for the desired stock on the following website: finviz, marketplace, google news, and applies Vader to find an overall sentiment of the given day based on all the headlines given by the website and then shows a graph

## How do you read the graphs?
The scores are between 1 and -1 on the y-axis.

The closer to 1 the better, and vice versa.

## Conclusion 
In this test, I found that different website will not have the exact same news: news might be missing but with three different websites we can overall assess a feeling of what the market might feel. We can also assess if the website may have biasesÂ¶

## For example on March 5, 2021: 
On finviz, we have all three tickers upto a certain date. But netflix has strong reportings everyday.

On marketwatch, we are missing a lot of tickers for each day. But we noticed that on 2021-04-03 there has been a negative report on amazon, but that was not reported on finviz

On google news we have a lot more data, and we can see that Google has many (3) negative headlines that were not reported on the other news website

## For example on Feb 14, 2021: 
On MarketWatch, there is no Amazon or NFLX for Feb 14, 2021. And the negative reporting for Google is much worse than the reporting on finviz.

Whereas on FinViz, we have all three companies
