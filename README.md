## What does it do?
Helps the traders to make a buying decision based on the month : this script retrieves the stock csv files through the unofficial yahoo finance api into a dataframe and calculates the the monthly average performance of a stock/ticker and plots it


## How do you read the graphs?
The x-axis indicates the months in numerical values

The y-axis are the average of the performance in %

## Conclusion 
We can observe that in the following graph for SPY, past 12 years (2010-2022) 

The best months to invest are 1,5,6,8,9 maybe 3,12 because those times are least profitable and also cconsidered 'dips'
